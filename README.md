**amlpy**

amlpy is a small-scale tool designed to analyze Affymetrix microarray data for detecting acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Utilizing several AI/ML methods, amlpy can assess mRNA microarray samples to determine the likelihood of them being cancerous.

## 🚀 **Features**

amlpy offers several features designed to facilitate effective analysis and interpretation of microarray data:

Data Preprocessing: Automates the cleaning and normalization of Affymetrix microarray data to prepare it for analysis.

Machine Learning Model Training & Evaluation: Implements robust training procedures with cross-validation to optimize and evaluate predictive models.

Cancer Prediction Generation: Delivers predictions on the probability of AML presence in microarray samples

## 🛠️ **Installation**
To get started with amlpy, follow these steps to set up the environment on your local machine:

1) Clone the Repository: Clone the amlpy repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tuulu/amlpy.git

cd amlpy
```
2) Install dependencies: Install all necessary Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 📊 **Data**
Ensure you have the necessary data files before proceeding with the usage steps. 
The tool is designed to work with Affymetrix microarray data files, which should be formatted as specified in the .src/data_format_specifications.md document (consider adding this document for clarity).

## 🧪 **Usage**

1) Please ensure you have the data downloaded first by running .src/data_import.py as a standalone script 
```bash
python src/data_import.py
```
2) Once the datasets are installed, start the pipeline by running .
```bash
python main.py
```
